# Google Chrome's Dinosaur Game
### We all have once in our life played the simple game in Googleâ€™s Chrome browser that we can access only when there is the cuttout in our internet connection. A fun and simple way to pass time while waiting for the connection to return. The dino character is not only cute but also represents a pre-historic period without internet.



### So in this project I tried to recreate the game in the Arduino platform. This is project is fairly simple and fun too.
